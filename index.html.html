WODDSTOCK SCHOOL IS A VERY NICE SCHOOL.IT IS MY FAVOURITE SCHOOL NOWADAYS, EARLIER DUE TO ITS STRICT RULES AND REGULATION I CONSIDERED IT A BAD SCHOOL BUT SOON WHEN I 
GREW UP AND SLOWLY WHEN MY MIND DEVELOPED I REALISED THAT HOW BEING A DISCIPLINE CHILD IS A VERY GOOD THING AND IT MAKES A VERY HUGE STATUS IN THE SOCIETY. FOR THE 
EDUCATION THIS SCHOOL IS BETTER THAN OTHER BECAUSE AS IN OTHER SCHOOL ONLY FEW THINGS ARE MADE US UNDERSTAND AND REST OF THE THING IS GIVEN IN HOMEWORK DUE TO WHICH 
THE STUDENTS FACE VERY DIFFICULTIES IN UNDERSTANDING THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT.IN MOST OF THE SCHOOL ONE OR TWO SUM IS TEACHED IN MATH AND REST HOMEWORK BUT IN THIS 
SCHOOL PAWAN SIR MY MOST FAVOURITE TEACHER AND WE STUDENTS CALL THEM MATH SIR WHO CLEARS OUR EVERY DOUBT IN MATH. I AM VEY HAPPY AND LUCKY TO BE IN THIS SCHOOL.
